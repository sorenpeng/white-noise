# Refactoring Plan: Homepage Animation

This document outlines the plan to refactor the homepage animation of your application, drawing inspiration from the `shader-showcase` project.

## 1. Install Dependencies

The first step is to install the necessary library for the shader effect.

- **Install `@paper-design/shaders-react`**: This library provides the `MeshGradient` component that will be used to create the animated background.

  ```bash
  pnpm install @paper-design/shaders-react
  ```

## 2. Create the `ShaderBackground` Component

Next, we will create a new component that will encapsulate the animated background.

- **Create `components/shader-background.tsx`**: This component will be responsible for rendering the `MeshGradient`. It will be similar to the one in the `shader-showcase` project, with two `MeshGradient` components layered on top of each other.

## 3. Create the `PulsingCircle` Component

To add more dynamism to the scene, we will create a pulsing circle component.

- **Create `components/pulsing-circle.tsx`**: This component will render a `div` with CSS animations to create a pulsing effect. This will be placed on top of the `ShaderBackground`.

## 4. Integrate the New Components into the Homepage

Finally, we will integrate the newly created components into the main page of the application.

- **Modify `app/page.tsx`**: The main page will be updated to use the `ShaderBackground` as the main container. The `HeroContent` and `PulsingCircle` components will be placed inside it.

## 5. (Optional) Add SVG Filters

For a more advanced effect, you can add SVG filters to the `ShaderBackground` component.

- **Add SVG filters**: You can add the `glass-effect` and `gooey-filter` from the `shader-showcase` project to the `ShaderBackground` component to enhance the visual effect.
